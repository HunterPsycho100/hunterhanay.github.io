                        Hi, I'm Hunter Hanay. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Seattle Pacific University and I've had the privilege to work at Avanade, where I honed my skills in client management, from gathering requirements to navigating intricate challenges, all while upholding consulting excellence. I've directly worked on creating a mobile-first, web-based insurance quoting app, taking lead roles in database design, API endpoint creation, and modernizing legacy business logic. Through this, I've collaborated intensively with senior developers, immersing myself in CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, contributing to agile practices and ensuring seamless integration of our software.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Additionally, during my Avanade internship, I developed a robust employee management system using Java Spring Boot and Angular. This experience deepened my expertise in creating dynamic UIs, RESTful APIs, and managing relational databases.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        My project, Trainr.Space, stands as a testament to my ability to lead and manage teams, where I helped in connecting trainers with clients using a React frontend and AWS backend. Here, I learned to navigate AWS, build React apps, and manage team dynamics effectively.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        My goal is to join a company where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue growing as a software developer.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Overall, I bring a diverse skill set, including proficiency in C#, .NET Core, Angular, HTML, CSS, and various Azure services. Whether it's client interaction, team leadership, or hands-on development, I'm equipped and excited to contribute!"
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        I'd love to share more about my work and experiences with you. Let's connect on LinkedIn or, if you'd like, I can send you my portfolio and resume to provide a more in-depth look at my projects and technical skills. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to exploring potential opportunities with your organization.

                <p>
                    We created a web-based, mobile-first, data-driven insurance quoting application for the insurance company's agents. I gathered requirements from stakeholders, proposed solutions that best suited differing needs, and achieved customer sign-off on designs. I utilized Azure App Services and Angular to create a responsive, user-friendly, and accessible UI at a low pay-per-use-cost. My primary responsibilities were designing the database schema, creating a code-first database using Entity Framework Core, writing API endpoints, and refactoring the legacy system business logic into the new system. I employed Angular components to build a dynamic user interface that reflected CRUD operations and database table relationships. I passed data between components using property binding, event binding, and custom events, and implemented routing to navigate between different pages and components. The database was a Microsoft SQL Server with tables featuring one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. I followed a 3-layer design pattern. I used the controller layer in ASP.NET to process requests from the Angular client. Some other additional responsibilities included integrating the Angular client with the SQL database. My experience with Angular as a back-end developer was short but intensive, but I enjoyed the process.
                </p>  
                <p>  
                    We then delivered a demo of the application and communicated what hasn't been completed and the future plans in the next following sprints.

                    I developed an employee management system using a Java Spring Boot backend and an Angular frontend to keep track of employees and their projects. The frontend employed a service to handle HTTP requests for displaying employee information and managing incoming search requests based on first name, last name, or email. The backend utilized RESTful API endpoints (GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) and Spring controllers. I employed Angular components to build a dynamic user interface that reflected CRUD operations and database table relationships. I passed data between components using property binding, event binding, and custom events, and implemented routing to navigate between different pages and components. The database was a Microsoft SQL Server with tables featuring one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. I followed a 3-layer design pattern. I used the controller layer to process requests from the client. In my application layer, I created business logic for data access and transformation. I handled data transformation my mapping entities to app bound DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to ensure that clean data could transfer from multiple tables through one request. I used Spring data JPA in the repository layer to access, persist, and manage data between the Java objects and the relational database.

                            Trainr.Space is a progressive web application that helps connect a trainer and their clients in an all in one platform. The Trainer provides a class code that the client uses to enter the class page. The Trainer and the clients have the ability to make posts and comments as well as uploading pictures and documents. Our team went through a full lifecycle of a project starting with planning sprints and stories, designing the architecture, and writing up documentation and then implementing and delivering demos.

                        <p>
                            It was built using React and AWS Amplify & AppSync. AWS Amplify provides a git-based workflow for hosting full-stack serverless web app with continuous deployment. AWS AppSync provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, including DynamoDB and HTTP APIs. AppSync did a lot of the heavy lifting such as automatic GraphQL schema generation from DynamoDB and integration with Amazon Cognito to control permissions for different user groups in the app and manage authentication.

                            I was responsible for building out the skeleton of the application and implementing API's with UI components using GraphQL. I would also lead daily stand up and Sprint Retrospectives.

                        <p>
                            This local project was built using the React library. It is a flowchart that shows the most efficient class schedule for your major. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application takes in a .txt file with all the major's course requirements (class code, name, prereqs, quarter availability, and credits). I parsed the info into JSON format which made the data clean and easier to access for future functions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then created an adjacency list by first creating a list of all the class codes. Those class codes would be used to access the JSON information and whenever a class could have any prereqs, I would add the current class to the adjacency list that was associated to the prereqs. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then took that adjacency list and put it into a topological sort which puts it in a list where all the nodes are pointed in one direction. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then populated a queue in in that topological order with the class codes. I looped through the queue and validated if the class item at the front of the queue passed the prereq requirements, the credit space for that quarter, and whether the class was available for that quarter. If the class item did pass, then it would be added to the class schedule and marked as visited. If the class did not pass the validation process then it was appended to the queue. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After opening the application in your localhost server, you are presented with an input of the major's txt file, how many credits you would like to take per quarter and what quarter you would like to begin in. Then you hit submit, and a flowchart would be populated with the courses organized by year and quarter.
