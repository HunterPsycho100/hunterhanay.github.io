                        Hi, I'm Hunter Hanay. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Seattle Pacific University and I've had the privilege to work at Avanade, where I honed my skills in client management, from gathering requirements to navigating intricate challenges, all while upholding consulting excellence. I've directly worked on creating a mobile-first, web-based insurance quoting app, taking lead roles in database design, API endpoint creation, and modernizing legacy business logic. Through this, I've collaborated intensively with senior developers, immersing myself in CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, contributing to agile practices and ensuring seamless integration of our software.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Additionally, during my Avanade internship, I developed a robust employee management system using Java Spring Boot and Angular. This experience deepened my expertise in creating dynamic UIs, RESTful APIs, and managing relational databases.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        My project, Trainr.Space, stands as a testament to my ability to lead and manage teams, where I helped in connecting trainers with clients using a React frontend and AWS backend. Here, I learned to navigate AWS, build React apps, and manage team dynamics effectively.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        My goal is to join a company where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue growing as a software developer.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Overall, I bring a diverse skill set, including proficiency in C#, .NET Core, Angular, HTML, CSS, and various Azure services. Whether it's client interaction, team leadership, or hands-on development, I'm equipped and excited to contribute!"
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        I'd love to share more about my work and experiences with you. Let's connect on LinkedIn or, if you'd like, I can send you my portfolio and resume to provide a more in-depth look at my projects and technical skills. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to exploring potential opportunities with your organization.

                <p>
                    We created a web-based, mobile-first, data-driven insurance quoting application for the insurance company's agents. I gathered requirements from stakeholders, proposed solutions that best suited differing needs, and achieved customer sign-off on designs. I utilized Azure App Services and Angular to create a responsive, user-friendly, and accessible UI at a low pay-per-use-cost. My primary responsibilities were designing the database schema, creating a code-first database using Entity Framework Core, writing API endpoints, and refactoring the legacy system business logic into the new system. I employed Angular components to build a dynamic user interface that reflected CRUD operations and database table relationships. I passed data between components using property binding, event binding, and custom events, and implemented routing to navigate between different pages and components. The database was a Microsoft SQL Server with tables featuring one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. I followed a 3-layer design pattern. I used the controller layer in ASP.NET to process requests from the Angular client. Some other additional responsibilities included integrating the Angular client with the SQL database. My experience with Angular as a back-end developer was short but intensive, but I enjoyed the process.
                </p>  
                <p>  
                    We then delivered a demo of the application and communicated what hasn't been completed and the future plans in the next following sprints.

                <p>
                    I developed an employee management system using a Java Spring Boot backend and an Angular frontend to keep track of employees and their projects. The frontend employed a service to handle HTTP requests for displaying employee information and managing incoming search requests based on first name, last name, or email. The backend utilized RESTful API endpoints (GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) and Spring controllers. I employed Angular components to build a dynamic user interface that reflected CRUD operations and database table relationships. I passed data between components using property binding, event binding, and custom events, and implemented routing to navigate between different pages and components. The database was a Microsoft SQL Server with tables featuring one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. I followed a 3-layer design pattern. I used the controller layer to process requests from the client. In my application layer, I created business logic for data access and transformation. I handled data transformation my mapping entities to app bound DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to ensure that clean data could transfer from multiple tables through one request. I used Spring data JPA in the repository layer to access, persist, and manage data between the Java objects and the relational database.

                                This is a personal project of mine where I am streamlining the grocery shopping experience. I have a 
                                hard time planning what I want to eat and remembering dishes I've made in the past, so I created an 
                                application that holds a list of recipes with all the ingredients needed for the recipe. Then on the 
                                home page, the user can click a recipe to add it's ingredients to their grocery list. The application 
                                was built locally using the dotnet CLI, React for the frontend, ASP.NET for the backend, and used 
                                Entity Framework Core to convert my code-first database to PostgreSQL for the database. Once I 
                                developed the minimal viable product, I hosted the application on Azure App Services and created a 
                                Github Action to automate the build and deployment to Azure. I also moved my Postgresql database from 
                                my local computer to an Azure SQL Server database in the Azure cloud. I learned a lot about creating 
                                and managing resources in the Azure portal and choosing the right plan for my application needs.

                                Trainr.Space is a progressive web application designed to connect trainers with their clients on a 
                                unified platform. Clients join classes using codes provided by trainers, and both can post comments, 
                                upload pictures, and share documents. The project underwent a full lifecycle, including planning 
                                sprints, designing architecture, writing documentation, and delivering demos. It was developed using 
                                React, AWS Amplify, and AppSync. Amplify supports serverless full-stack web apps with continuous 
                                deployment, while AppSync, using GraphQL, handles data integration from multiple sources and manages 
                                user authentication and permissions with Amazon Cognito. My role included building the application's 
                                framework, integrating APIs with UI components, and leading daily stand-ups and sprint retrospectives.

                                This project, built using React, creates an efficient class schedule flowchart for your major. It inputs a 
                                .txt file containing the major's course requirements, parses the data into JSON for ease of access, and 
                                generates an adjacency list using class codes. These codes retrieve data from the JSON, linking 
                                prerequisites to their respective classes. The classes are then arranged using a topological sort, 
                                forming a directed graph. The sorted class codes are queued, and each class is validated for 
                                prerequisites, credit limits, and availability. Validated classes are added to the schedule, 
                                while others are requeued. Users input their major, desired credits per quarter, and starting 
                                quarter on the localhost server, resulting in a flowchart organized by year and quarter.
